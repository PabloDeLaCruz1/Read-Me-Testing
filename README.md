**Technology Stack:**

**Requirements definition**


---



1. List requirements. Break down big requirements into small parts. 
2. Write a user story for each requirement and add it to the Scrum Board. Why? 

        **“As a:** <role> **I want to:** <function-description>** So I can: **<value-statement>**”**


        A user story can be represented as a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/3ZU4qfOY/agile-controller-board)(Scrum) card. You can write the whole story in the card title like this:


        
![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")



        But this can look a bit crowded when you have many cards like these in a list. It's not optimal when trying to quickly scan a list of tasks. An alternative approach is to use a short form containing only the what in the card title:

3. Outline Powerpoint presentation

1. Everyone starts by pulling the skeleton from github and pushing back to their own branch. 
2. When ready to start. Take a story from the Scrum Board and implement. 

**Quality assurance**
